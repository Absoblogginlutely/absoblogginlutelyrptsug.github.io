talk-title: Filtering Files at Scale
abstract:
    Searching for files in large data sets can be a real drag. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack! How do you do that quickly?
    <br><br>
    While most Powershell problems are I/O bound, sometimes the limitation is memory. Mark will show the many ways that I/O can slow your PS scripts, using file filtering methods as examples. The overarching topic of this presentation is performance analysis. 
    <br><br>
    Let's dive into different methods available for searching for files at scale using available tools/utilities. We'll discuss pros and cons and how to improve results to boost performance.

**Overview**

The focus of this session will be on leveraging some well-known, and not-so well known, PowerShell modules to save time and mitigate risk when it comes to solving a scripting challenge. Very often, sys-admins and developers will search for code examples to piece together a solution, when a perfect tool already exists, and are usually free. Weâ€™ll review some common challenges and PowerShell modules that often fit very well with each of those challenges.

**Examples**

DbaTools, Carbon, PsWindowsUpdate, HaveIBeenPwned, ADSIPS, Posh365, IISAdministration, CredentialManager, and several more.
