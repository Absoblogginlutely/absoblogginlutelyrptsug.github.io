Why you should use PSReadLine & how to get started

Microsoft short description: PSReadLine provides an improved command line editing experience in the PowerShell console.

Using PSReadline we have:
1. Syntax coloring of the command line
2. A visual indication of syntax errors
3. A better multi-line experience (both editing and history)
4. Customizable key bindings
5. Cmd and Emacs modes
6. Many configuration options
7. Bash style completion (optional in Cmd mode, default in Emacs mode)
8. Emacs yank/kill ring
9. PowerShell token based “word” movement and jkill

**POWERSHELL COMPATIBILITY**

PSReadLine requires PowerShell 3.0, or newer, and the console host. It does not work in PowerShell ISE. It does work in the console of Visual Studio Code.
