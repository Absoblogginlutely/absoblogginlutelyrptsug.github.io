talk-title: Don't do what I did! Avoiding Azure $urprise$!
abstract:
    You want to dip your toes in the cloud space, but it seems daunting and expensive regardless of the platform. In this session, I will identify the hard (and expensive) lessons I learned while leveling up myself in Microsoft Azure. We’ll start with creating a game plan to getting our hands dirty and identifying the gotcha’s along the way in an effort to keep your Azure spend down while you’re leveling up in this space and of course leveraging the Azure PowerShell module along the way.
