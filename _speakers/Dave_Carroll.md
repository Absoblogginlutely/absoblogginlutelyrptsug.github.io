Systems administrators and software developers have been divided for years, not just in job duties, but also organizationally, culturally, and philosophically. We will examine one systems administrator’s journey to see how they acquired some of the prerequisite skill sets and changed their mindset on the path to DevOps.

Specifically, we will progress through the systems administrator’s experiences as they relate to each facet of the DevOps framework CALMS, with the spotlight prominently on automation. The examples and quick demonstrations will take us through code editors, source control, testing, and tools for continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD).
