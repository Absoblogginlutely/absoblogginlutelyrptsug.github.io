talk-title: Why can't we be friends? Command Line Utilities + PowerShell = <3
abstract:
    Command line utilities are great. But they don’t follow PowerShell patterns. They don’t produce objects and they don’t support the pipeline. They output to the console and that’s the end of the line. Or is it? Learn how you can bring the benefits of PowerShell to your command line utilities.

In this session we’ll take a common command line utility and transform it into a PowerShell cmdlet. We’ll start off by learning some techniques to effectively and easily parse console output. From there we’ll show how we can take that parsed output and turn it into an object. Next, we’ll wrap that code into a simple function. And lastly, we’ll give that function pipeline support. By the end we’ll have transformed a command line utility into a fully fledged PowerShell tool which accepts pipeline input and produces objects.
