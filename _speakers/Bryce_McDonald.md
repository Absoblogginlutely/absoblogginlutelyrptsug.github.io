***GitHub for PowerShell Users***

As the world transitions to the cloud and “infrastructure as code”, understanding high-level git concepts is more important than ever. In this talk, you’ll learn how to install, configure, and utilize GitHub repositories to develop and store your code.

**Git Overview**

Geared toward beginners, this will cover some git concepts at a high level so we all are working on the same playing field and using the same vocabulary when talking about git, GitHub, and source code management. Once we cover it at a high level, we’ll dive in deeper to using git specifically with PowerShell.

**Installing and Configuring Git**

Beyond simply installing git-scm.exe there are modifications you can make to your PowerShell profile to give a more visual representation of your staged and unstaged git changes. We’ll cover these to make git much more functional for a PowerShell admin.

The next step we will cover is to configure Git for use with a remote repository and show you how to manage your “remotes”.

**Using Git**

Lastly, we’ll use some live examples of how git can be used to manage our source code, be utilized in an infrastructure-as-code environment, and open the door for using git in your organization.
