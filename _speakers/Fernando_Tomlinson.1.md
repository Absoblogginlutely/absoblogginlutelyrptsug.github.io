In today’s environment, the language is being used for defensive hunting, forensics, attacker reconnaissance, escalation, exfiltration, or lateral movement.

Walking away, you will be better postured to identify these tactics or use them for specific purposes without adding anything additional to the network.

This talk revolves around the use of PowerShell and supporting aspects as a suitable option for an incident response solution for endpoints in your environment, to include shortfalls of the language.
