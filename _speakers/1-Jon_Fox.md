PowerShell has long been one of the potential eye sores in an attack mitigation framework - mostly because it has been abused so much as a critical tool in the attackers kill chain. People like to click on things and email attachments can host a bunch of evil things - all of which only do harm if PowerShell is working, but not secured. Whether you reference the ATT&CK framework or others, PowerShell is ever present. I will cover the basics of PowerShell’s built-in security model, why its more secure than almost all other “shells” and how an individual as well as an organization can prevent the old abuses from occurring on their systems, using built-in, free approaches. I will touch on logging, auditing, potential lock-downs (AppLocker & Group Policy), DSC and JEA.
