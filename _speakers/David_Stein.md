**Overview**

The focus of this session will be on leveraging some well-known, and not-so well known, PowerShell modules to save time and mitigate risk when it comes to solving a scripting challenge. Very often, sys-admins and developers will search for code examples to piece together a solution, when a perfect tool already exists, and are usually free. Weâ€™ll review some common challenges and PowerShell modules that often fit very well with each of those challenges.

**Examples**

DbaTools, Carbon, PsWindowsUpdate, HaveIBeenPwned, ADSIPS, Posh365, IISAdministration, CredentialManager, and several more.
