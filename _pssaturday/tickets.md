                        Attendees for our event have two ticket options for our event.

                        - We offer a one-day pass to the Saturday event for $75. Lunch and snacks are included.
                        - We also offer a two day pass to the PowerShell Saturday & the Cybersecurity deep dive on Sunday. The two-day pass is $125. Lunch and snacks are included for both days. 

                        Our Sunday Cybersecurity deep dive is limited to 60 seats and they're moving fast! Once they're gone, there is no way into the the Sunday event!
