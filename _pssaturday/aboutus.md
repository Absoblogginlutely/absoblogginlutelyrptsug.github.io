PowerShell Saturday (aka PS-Saturday) is a full day of learning hosted by the Research Triangle PowerShell user group. In addition to in-depth learning, this event is an opportunity for IT professionals of all skill levels to be exposed to new ideas presented by members of the PowerShell community. 

The Research Triangle PowerShell users group is the largest PowerShell community in the United States with over 900 members that meet regularly online and in-person to share ideas with fellow community members. The group leaders wanted to take all the great ideas shared at our monthly meetings and present them as a full day of learning that goes deeper than what can be accomplished in a one hour meeting. The event will be a collection of ideas and tutorials based around three distinct areas:
- PowerShell 101 (Core Concepts and Fundamentals)
- PowerShell Tools (Scripting Tools and DevOps)
- Managing the Cloud with PowerShell (Azure and AWS)

Conference attendees will spend a full day watching demos, learning new ways to accomplish everyday tasks and engaging in discussions with like-minded professionals. Breakfast, lunch and light snacks will be provided throughout the day. There will be opportunities to network and discuss ideas with other conference attendees. All attendees can look forward to free tools and prizes just for participating.

We invite you to join us for PowerShell Saturday, a unique opportunity to share ideas and expand your knowledge with other members of the community.
