### When will the line-up of topics and speakers be announced

We started accepting speakers' submissions in mid-April and we'll close the submission process on June 2nd. Once that process closes, we'll select topics for the event and announce our roster of topics and speakers by June 15th. Once the speakers are selected, we update this page with a full roster of speakers, their topics and their bios.

### What will our conference look like?

We'll be selecting approximately 15 presentation topics that will be spread across three main categories. Our goal is to provide unique and informative sessions that not only educate but engage our attendees. The Raleigh Triangle PowerShell group has always had a stellar lineup of local and national speakers and we expect the same for our one day event.

Our group is known for delivering great content as well as being super friendly and welcoming to all members and all skill levels. We are looking to reproduce the small community feel of our meetings in the full day setting of this conference. Our speakers love us because we put a lot of effort into helping speakers do the best they can to be successful.

### What credentials are needed to be a speaker? 

This event is open to speakers of all skill levels and this is an excellent opportunity to get experience in presenting content to an audience. We are very happy to work with first-time speakers as long as your topic is relevant to the information topics  defined for our event. All you need is a passion for PowerShell and an interesting topic. If you are wondering if you can do this, you can!

The main thing our speakers need to be selected is a complete idea that will engage an audience. The audience will be a mix of beginner, intermediate and advanced PowerShell users spread across many different areas of IT. Talks should be mostly code and demos rather then slides. It is certainly ok to use slides, but we would prefer to have as much live demo material and interactions between speakers and participants as possible. Recorded video is also acceptable as backups to live demos.
